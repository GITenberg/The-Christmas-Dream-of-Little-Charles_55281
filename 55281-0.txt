  THE CHRISTMAS DREAM

  OF LITTLE CHARLES.

  [Illustration: Decorative scroll]


ONE Christmas eve, little Charles Estabrook hung his
stocking carefully by the chimney corner, and, after saying
his prayers, got into bed, and soon fell asleep. Charles was
a good little boy; he was fond of horses, and took pleasure
in feeding them and attending to their wants. On the day
previous, a traveller came along; his horse was thirsty; so
little Charles got a pail, filled it with water, and gave the
horse to drink, for which the traveller rewarded him by
giving him a shilling.

[Illustration: Tying a shoe lace]

But, although so fond of horses, little Charles was not
unmindful of the claims of his sister Lizzy, as she was
familiarly called, and, in pleasant weather, would go out to
walk with her. In the engraving opposite, they are on their
way to school together, and have stopped that he may tie her
shoe, which has become unfastened.

Charles dreamed that he was in bed, peeping at his stocking,
over the bed-clothes, when he saw a very pleasant-looking
old gentleman come down the chimney, on a nice little pony,
precisely like the one named Lightfoot, that his Uncle Ben
had promised to give him. It was funny, indeed, to see the
pony slide down feet foremost, and Charles could not help
laughing; but he laughed still louder, when he examined Old
Nicholas the rider. His hair was made of crackers, and as he
came nearer and nearer to the lamp, that stood on the
hearth, pop went off one of the crackers, then another, and
then another. But St. Nicholas was not a bit frightened; he
only rubbed his ears with his coat-sleeve, patted the pony
to keep him quiet, and laughed till he showed the concave of
his great mouth, full of sugar-plums.

  “He was chubby and plump,
     A right jolly old elf—
   Charley laughed when he saw him,
     In spite of himself;
   While a wink of his eye,
     A twist of his head,
   Soon gave him to know
     He had nothing to dread.”

Charles was excessively delighted, and shouted so loud that
his mother thought he had the nightmare. He watched the old
gentleman closely, and then looked at his stocking. It hung
very conveniently. “He can’t put the pony in it,” said he to
himself; “that’s a pity.”

[Illustration: Church tower]

The old gentleman’s pockets stuck out prodigiously, and he
panted and puffed as if he had been cudgelling an alligator.
“Well,” said he, wiping the perspiration off his face,
although it was the 25th of December, “if this is not hard
work. Eighty-five youngsters have I called on the last hour.
Hark! St. Michael’s sounds loud down the chimney. One, two.
I shall have a tough job, from two o’clock till daylight,
popping down the chimneys from the Battery to the High bridge.
I wonder what this chap would like for a Christmas present,”
continued he, eying the stocking; then putting his arms
akimbo, he began to consider. Charles’s heart beat. “Good
Mr. Nicholas,” said he to himself, “if you could only give
me that pony.” But he kept quite still, for he saw the old
man put his hands into his tremendous pockets. “Let me see,”
said old Nicholas, “here is a jack-knife that I was to have
given Tommy Battle, if he had not quarrelled with his sisters.
Open sesame!” The stocking opened, and in went the jack-knife.
It was the very thing that Charles wanted. One after another
the old gentleman pulled out tops, twine, marbles, dissected
maps, picture-books, sugar-plums, besides divers other
notions, all the while talking to himself. “This drum,” said
he, “is for Tom Barnwell, a clever little fellow who never
tells lies. These pretty little fish-hooks and line Master
Troup must have, for his patient care of his father when he
was sick. This mask is for Orace Allen; he must not use it
to frighten little children, or I shall remember it when
Christmas comes again. Let me see, I will give this globe to
Joseph Dudley, who is a studious boy, and he will make a
good use of it. This pretty annual was for William Wiley,
but the lad kicked his brother, and called him a bad name,
so I will lay it by for George Wilde.”

[Illustration: Globe]

Charles thought he could stay for ever to see the old
gentleman take out his knicknacks, and tell who they were
for; but he began to be a little frightened for his own
stocking, when he recollected that he had been remiss in his
Latin the last quarter. “I hope the old gentleman does not
understand the classics,” said Charley to himself; but he
stopped short, for his queer visiter held up the stocking,
saying, “I think this lad loves gunpowder by the smell of
his stocking.” He then took hold of his hair, and pulling
out crackers by the dozen from his head, tied them up into
neat parcels, and threw them into the stocking. As fast as
he pulled them off, new crackers appeared, and hung down
over his ears and forehead. “This accounts for the noise we
hear on Christmas,” said Charles; “I never knew who made all
the crackers!” and he had to hold his sides for laughing,
the old man looked so droll.

[Illustration: Bed]

When the old gentleman stooped over the light to put a new
supply in the stocking, an unusual number exploded, and the
little pony giving a start up the chimney, disappeared.

[Illustration: Horse]

Charles awoke; it was just daylight. He sprung out of bed,
roused all the family with his “Merry Christmas,” ran to the
stable, and what should he see, but Uncle Ben’s little pony,
with a halter on his neck, on which was tied a piece of
paper, written, “A merry Christmas, with the pony Lightfoot,
for my nephew Charles!”

[Illustration: Decorative scroll]




  THE LITTLE COLT.

  SPOKEN BY A LITTLE BOY.


  PRAY how shall I, a little lad,
    In speaking make a figure;
  You are but jesting, I’m afraid.
    Do wait till I am bigger.

  But since you wish to hear my part,
    And urge me to begin it,
  I’ll strive for praise with all my art,
    Though small my chance to win it.

  I’ll tell a tale how Farmer John
    A little roan colt bred, sir,
  And every night and every morn
    He watered and he fed, sir.

  Said Neighbor Joe, to Farmer John,
    “You surely are a dolt, sir,
  To spend such daily care upon
    A little useless colt, sir.”

  The farmer answered wondering Joe,
    “I bring my little roan up,
  Not for the good he now can do,
    But may do when he’s grown up.”

  The moral you may plainly see,
    To keep the tale from spoiling;
  The little colt you think is me—
    I know it by your smiling.

  I now entreat you to excuse
    My lisping and my stammers,
  And, since you’ve learned my parent’s views,
    I’ll humbly make my manners.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
